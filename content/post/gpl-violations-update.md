To all the people telling me to f****** learn to read and to RTFM the **GPL**:
I have read the **GPL**, this is not my first project being released as
**Free software, as Open Source software or under the GPL**
([Descartes BI](http://code.google.com/p/descartes-bi/),
[Django-replication](https://github.com/rosarior/django-replication),
[pdf-form-fill](https://github.com/rosarior/pdf-form-fill)).
It is also not the first project to enjoy widespread use and to be released
as a commercial product by other people (Django-inventory), however in those
instances the people doing the forks have complied with the GPL admirably
providing source code for their changes, retaining all copyrights, notices
and original license even when being released under a different name.
That however is not the situation that is happening now. This is not
“whinnying over some little program” (as it is being described commonly in
the feedback I’m getting via email), the **GPL** is no less legal than a
commercial license and must be followed and enforced equally, **Mayan EDMS** is
not some “little program” currently sporting 26,000 lines of code. And just
because a program is being released as **Free Open Source** software doesn’t
make it any less valuable than a commercial counterpart. Finally the entire
source was not removed, only the development branch and the hotfix branch for
the next version. Let me repeat that again, the entire source code was **NOT**
removed only the **TWO (2)** latest **unreleased** branches. Lastly about 
commercial competition issue: If **I have no problems with people or business
making money off Mayan EDMS, in fact I proud myself in creating commercial
opportunities to others by advertising them, right here, in this very website,
on the top menu, three tabs to the right**. I hope this clarifies and
overturns some of the misinformation being circulated, thank you.
