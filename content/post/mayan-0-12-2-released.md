This is the second maintenance release of the 0.12 series. Issues covered in this version: more secure auto admin creation, new logo in place, installation environment report app for remote debugging, anonymous statistics gathering, German translation by Tetja Rediske and Tilmann Sittig and a fix for the duplicated extension bug when uploading a new document version. One new feature of importance is the ability to check out documents effectively blocking new versions of the document while the original user that checked out the document updates it.
