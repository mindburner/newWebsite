New release of Mayan EDMS in time for Xmas.
Improving the end user experience was the main focus of this release, easing
the learning curve and removing one of the most common adoption barriers.
To this accomplish this an app called Bootstrap setups was added that lowers
the time and knowledge required to start using Mayan EDMS from the moment
of installation. The bootstrap app works by synchronizing a list of
prepackaged setups from a central repository so as more setups are published
more setups will be available for users and consultants with the click of a
button. This app also has the ability of “dumping” the setup of an existing
installation for easy sharing, which is ideal for consultants helping their
costumers configure Mayan EDMS. To compliment this app, a new chapter
catering to the initial steps required to start using Mayan EDMS was added
to the documentation and will continue to be expanded in subsequent
releases: http://mayan.readthedocs.org/en/v0.13/intro/getting_started.html

Other features included: Bulk tagging and un-tagging of documents, moving
documents into folders in bulk, limit indexes to a document type, permission
system optimization for a nice speed up, the most amount of issues closed
in any version (10).
