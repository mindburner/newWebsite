The time has come to move to the next level, that is why Mayan EDMS’s code is
now moving to it’s own repository and organization in GitLab.
The new URL for the code is: https://github.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms

Be sure to update your Git remotes:

    git remote remove origin
    git remote add origin https://github.com/mayan-edms/mayan-edms.git
