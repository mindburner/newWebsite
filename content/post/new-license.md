Mayan EDMS is used by many other projects as a backend server providing OCR, file previews, storage or tagging services. Mayan EDMS is also embedded into other products, both free open source and commercial open source in nature, some are software only, others, are hardware based commercial document management solutions. Commercial collaboration has always been a goal of the project and because commercial use is even promoted, as evidenced in this same web site, it is time to take the next step. Effective in the next release, Mayan EDMS will be licensed under the Apache 2.0 License. This change in license will allow many things, among them, inclusion of Mayan EDMS into any commercial product without the product itself having to be offered as open source.
