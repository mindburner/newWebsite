The new website design is up an running using WordPress with the free version of the Figero theme (http://www.inkthemes.com/wp-themes/figero-wordpress-theme/). Iâ€™ve barely used WordPress before and design is not my area of expertise so tips, tweaks, or suggestions on the look from designers are most welcomed and needed :)
