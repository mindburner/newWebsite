For a change of pace and to take a break from the licensing issues and from going through all the feedback and opinions received, another recurrent item in my inbox from these days is that the official website needs a tune up, and I couldn’t agree more :) Visually and technologically too since the site is done by hand in static HTML and has no features. So if you are a designer or want to take a stab at it, send your mock-ups, screenshots or links to live demos of the redesign and they will be posted here for visitor to comment. Since any new CMS solution will most likely won’t be compatible with the current hosting at github, if any web hosting provider want to host the new site drop a line too. Thanks!
