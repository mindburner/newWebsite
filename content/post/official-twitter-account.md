Identity and social media are becoming more important even for Free Software
projects, so as was done with the code repository [recently](/post/new-home/),
giving it its own home and [Github organization](https://github.com/mayan-edms),
so has the time come to give **Mayan EDMS** its own social media voiceâ€¦

Announcing the Official **Mayan EDMS** Twitter account: https://twitter.com/MayanEDMS

What can you expect from this account? Up to date information about **Mayan EDMS**,
releases, simple questions and answers that are not meant for the technical
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mayan-edms) but fit in 140 characters.

The account is managed by volunteers whose day job is social media management
so it will be a very carefully curated information channel and a good example
how to contribute to Free Software projects in ways other than just code.
