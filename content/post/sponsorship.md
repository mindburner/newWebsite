We've received several inquiries from parties interested in sponsoring the
project in an official capacity. This is why today we are launching the
[sponsorship program]({{< relref "sponsors.md" >}}).

The sponsorship program is a great way to help Mayan EDMS
directly. Aside from monetary sponsorship, sponsors can also help with services,
equipment, or other types of non-cash contributions.

Sponsors will be listed in our [sponsors page]({{< relref "sponsors.md" >}})
for a year, with a link back to an URL of their choice, and will be announced on our
social media accounts.

If you'd like to become a sponsor, just email [sponsor@mayan-edms.com](mailto:sponsor@mayan-edms.com).
